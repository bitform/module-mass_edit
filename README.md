## module-mass_edit

This module lets you edit multiple submissions in one go, rather than have to click from page to page. With this module, submissions are presented in a table format - each row a separate submission. Because this can create extremely wide tables - wider than can fit on most screens - the module provides the option of displaying the content in a resizable, scrollable popup window.

Please see the documentation for more info.
