## Mass Edit module

> This module is no longer supported.

This module lets you edit multiple submissions in one go, rather than have to click from page to page. With this module, submissions are presented in a table format - each row a separate submission. Because this can create extremely wide tables - wider than can fit on most screens - the module provides the option of displaying the content in a resizable, scrollable popup window.
